# Publishing Guide: Edmund's Claude Code Plugin

Complete step-by-step instructions for publishing your Claude Code plugin to GitHub and making it available for others to install.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] GitHub account
- [ ] Git installed locally
- [ ] Repository renamed to `yoozek-claude-code` ✅
- [ ] All configuration files updated ✅

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### 1.1 Create New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `yoozek-claude-code`
   - **Description**: "Claude Code setup with 14 productivity commands and 11 specialized AI agents for .NET 10, React, and PostgreSQL development"
   - **Visibility**: Public (so others can install it)
   - **Initialize**: ❌ Don't add README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. Click "Create repository"

### 1.2 Push Your Local Repository

Once the GitHub repository is created, run these commands:

```bash
cd /path/to/yoozek-claude-code

# Add the GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yoozek/yoozek-claude-code.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

If you encounter authentication issues:
- Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
- Or set up SSH keys (recommended): https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

## Step 2: Verify Installation Works

Test that your plugin can be installed:

```bash
# Install from your GitHub repo
/plugin install yoozek/yoozek-claude-code

# Verify commands are available
/api-new
/ef-model
/feature-plan

# Verify agents are available (they'll activate automatically based on context)
```

To uninstall and test again:
```bash
/plugin uninstall yoozek-claude-code
```
